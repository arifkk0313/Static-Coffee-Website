        <h3>TYPES OF COFFEE BEANS</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>1- ROBUSTA</h4>
        <p class="paragraph"> Robusta beans have a bitter and grainy flavor with an undertone of the peanuts. The
            caffeine level in robusta is twice as compared to Arabica beans. Robusta has a higher yield and accounts for
            25% of the world’s demand.</p>
        <h4>2- ARABICA</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">As the name suggests, Arabica is the gift from the Yemen country of the Arabian peninsula.
            The oval-shaped and aromatic beans have a blend of sweet and bitter flavor. Its caffeine level is relatively
            low too</p>
        <h4>3- LIBERICA</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">These coffee beans have a smoky and nutty flavor with a lingering note of the dark
            chocolate. Liberica is one of the highest costing beans in the world, thanks to its rare cultivation. It is
            not as popular as the other two in India.</p>
        <h4>4- SELECTION 9</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">Selection 9 is developed from the breeding of Tafarikela and Hybrido-de-Timor. This
            rust-resistant variety topped the Cupping Competition of 2002 and won the Fine Cup Award for the best
            Arabica flavor of India.

    <h2 class="top5">TOP 5 COFFEE BRANDS </h2>

    <img class="brandimage" src="starbucks.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="brandname">STARBUCKS</h4>
    <p class="brandpara1">Founded in 1971 at Seattle, Washington
        Everyone knows about Starbucks, thanks to their aggressive marketing and shrewd advertising techniques. But,
        does everyone like Starbucks coffee? The answer differs.
        The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee beans are dark
        roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. .</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="brandpara2">Founded in 1950 at Canton, Massachusetts
        Dunkin' is not as big <br> a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of <br> stores. But
        yes, the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior <br> to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does not
        have the
        signature <br> burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. .</p>
    <img class="brandimage2" src="dunkin.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="brandname2">DUNKIN DONUTS</h4>
    <br><br>
    <img class="brandimage3" src="costa.png" alt="">
    <h4 class="brandname">COSTA COFFEE</h4>
    <p class="brandpara3">Founded in 1971 at London, United KingdomCosta coffee is one of the largest coffee chains in
        Britain. Having its presence in more than 31 countries worldwide, it has more than 3000 outlets serving coffee
        with around 18 thousand branches in the whole world.Costa coffees are medium roasted, which makes them smoother,
        sweeter, and nuttier.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="brandpara4">Founded in 1993 at Melbourne, AustraliaOwned by McDonald's, McCafe is one of the leading
        coffee chains in countries like Australia and New Zealand. McCafé enjoys the benefit of having a vast presence
        (Because let's face it, McDonald's is everywhere!) As McDonald's expands worldwide, there is a decent chance of
        McCafé doing the same.</p>
    <img class="brandimage4" src="mcafe.svg" alt="">
    <h4 class="brandname4">McCafé</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p class="brandpara5">Founded in 1938 at Switzerland If there is another coffee everyone has heard of, it is
        Nescafe. It's present almost anywhere in the globe. The instant coffee by Nescafe is unbeatable, not so much by
        taste as it is for availability. As for the taste, it sure is not the best instant coffee.</p>
